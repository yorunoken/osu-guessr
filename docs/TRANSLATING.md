# Translating osu!guessr

Thank you for your interest in translating osu!guessr! This guide will help you get started with contributing translations.

## Overview

osu!guessr uses JSON-based translation files located in `src/messages/`. Each language has its own file (e.g., `en.json` for English, `tr.json` for Turkish).

## Adding a New Language

1. Create a new file in `src/messages/` named `[language-code].json`
   - Use the standard two-letter language code (e.g., `fr.json` for French)
   - Copy the content from `en.json` as a starting point

3. Make sure to maintain the same structure as the English file, only changing the text values

## Translation Guidelines

1. **Keep Variables**: Maintain all variables in curly braces, such as:
   - `{osu_base}` → remains as is
   - `{count}` → remains as is
   - `{points}` → remains as is

2. **Placeholders**: Keep the same placeholder format:
   ```json
   "welcome": "Welcome, {username}!"
   ```

3. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the same JSON structure and keys as the English version

## Testing Your Translation

1. After adding your translation file, run the development server:
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

2. Switch to your language using the language selector in the UI

3. Test all pages and features to ensure translations appear correctly

## Submitting Your Translation

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `add-[language]-translation`
3. Add your translation file
4. Submit a Pull Request with:
   - The language you're adding
